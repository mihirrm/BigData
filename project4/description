This file contains a description of what the follwoing project is about.

part 1:-
1) part 1 deals with clustering of given data. aim was to cluster the given data into 10 cluster and run predcitions on that.
2) classifiers.py file contains all models built on classifiers like naive bayes, decision tree which are in spark mllib, and run predictions onn test data.
accuracy was calculated by splitting the training data into 60-40 ratio.
3) Alternate least square is recimmmendation system algorithm that is basically a latent factor model algorithm that split a given matrix into 2 matrix.
idea was to built als model on all training data and predict all the unknown values in the matrix.


part2 :-
part 2 aim is to use kafka streaming with apache spark framework for real time analysis.
kafka producer sends the twitter tweets from the its api, scrrapper puts all the data in the opic created.
consumer reads the data from topic ,performs real time analytics, and send it to elasticsearch index for index seearching.
elastic search is used for searching data in indexed manner.
Indexed data is visualized on kibana on tilemap, since data in elastic search contains geo cordinates.
